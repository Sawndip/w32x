What's the difference between SendMessage and PostMessage?

SendMessage sends to window proc (via CallWindowProc?)
PostMessage sends message to queue.

According to MSDN, WM_PAINT is not removed by GetMessage.
I think BeginPaint needs to remove it. Or possibly EndPaint.

======================
GetStockObject will initialize the stock objects on the first call.

Drawing

In Win32, drawing is done with a PEN (HPEN) object selected into the DC.
Painting is done with a BRUSH (HBRUSH) object selected into a DC.

In X11, basic drawing is done using the foreground member of the GC.. thus
to mimic Win32, we change the GC when we know we have to use brush and when
we have to use pen.

When filling a rectangle a brush is used in Win32, but in X11 the foreground
is still used.



DCs (aka GCs in X11).
=====================
According to MSDN, there are common DCs, DCs that belong to
a class, and private DC (i think this is from CS_OWNDC style) which makes
a specific window claim a DC.
