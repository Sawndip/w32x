# w32x
A Win32 inspired API/wrapper over Xlib/X11 for Linux and Unix machines.

# Requirements
Debian based systems require the following libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxft-dev
```

# Building
Simply change to the src directory and execute make.
This will build a static library called libw32x.a.
You can then change into the test directory to build a sample
app that utilizes the library.
